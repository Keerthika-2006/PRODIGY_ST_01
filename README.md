# PRODIGY_ST_01
This project contains manual test cases created for testing a web-based Simple Calculator application. The test cases are designed to validate the accuracy of arithmetic operations, ensure proper handling of valid and invalid inputs, and verify operator precedence (BODMAS).

**Application Under Test (AUT)**

URL: https://dunizb.github.io/sCalc/

Application Type: Web-based Application

**Objective**

The objective of this task is to:

Verify basic arithmetic operations

Validate handling of decimal and negative numbers

Ensure correct implementation of BODMAS (operator precedence)

Check proper error handling for invalid inputs such as division by zero

**Testing Types**
